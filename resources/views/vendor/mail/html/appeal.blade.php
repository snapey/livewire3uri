<strong>PLEASE CAN YOU HELP?</strong> SpeakerNet is currently free for both speakers and speaker-finders.
In order to keep it that way, can we encourage you to make a small donation towards its upkeep?
This will allow us to justify spending more time on improving the site and keeping 
it fit for purpose.<br />Visit <a href="https://speakernet.co.uk/donations">https://speakernet.co.uk/donations</a>
